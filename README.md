Usage
-----

Eternaly wait to acquire lock ``one.lock`` and execute command ``ping -t 0.0.0.0``.

```
zlock one.lock ping -t 0.0.0.0
```

Run command with limited time of execution set to 10 seconds.

```
zlock one.lock -t 10 ping -t 0.0.0.0
```

Wait for 5 seconds to acquire lock ``one.lock`` or fail.

Be verbose.

```
zlock -v -w 5 one.lock ping -t 0.0.0.0
```

Compilation
-----------

In case you need to compile without support for legacy .NET 2.0 change configuration in csproj file by removing ``net20``.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>

    <TargetFrameworks>net40;netcoreapp3.1;net20</TargetFrameworks>
```

```xml
    <TargetFrameworks>net40;netcoreapp3.1</TargetFrameworks>
```

For recent Linux distribution use netcoreapp6.0.

```xml
    <TargetFrameworks>netcoreapp6.0</TargetFrameworks>
```
